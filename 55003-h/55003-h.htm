<h2>ROSS CASTLE, KILLARNEY.</h2>

<p>We have heard some of our readers express surprise that we
should not before this have taken notice, among our topographical
collections, of some of the features of the far-famed
Lakes of Killarney; but the truth is, that those features,
though of the highest beauty, are not, for the greater part,
such as wood-cut illustrations could adequately express; and
even those which are properly suited to the powers of the graver
have been in most instances already so often drawn and
described, that it is now almost hopeless to expect to find either
any new points of view or historical incidents connected with
them, which have not already been made familiar to the reading
public. Still, as our little weekly pennyworth is not intended
exclusively for the wealthy and well informed, but even to
a greater extent for those by whom more expensive publications
are unattainable, it is right that we should occasionally
notice subjects of popular interest, however familiar they may
have been already made to a portion of our readers; and in
doing so, we trust that we shall be able to make them in
some degree acceptable to all, by the fidelity of our drawings,
or the occasional novelty of the facts with which we
shall illustrate them.</p>

<p>We have chosen, accordingly, as the first of our Killarney
subjects, the old favourite Ross Castle; not indeed as the best
or least hacknied, but as properly that which should begin the
series, for it is the first with which the Killarney tourist becomes
familiar, and from which he usually starts to enjoy all
the others.</p>

<p>In a historical and antiquarian point of view, however, Ross
Castle is indeed one of the most interesting objects to be
found in connection with the enchanting scenery of the lakes.
It is the time-worn fortress of their ancient chiefs, and its
presence connects the history of man in distant times with the
objects of eternal natural beauty by which it is surrounded,
and imparts to them that delightful feeling or charm of romance
which, exquisite as they are, they would necessarily want if
it were absent.</p>

<p>Ross Castle, as its present remains show, was similar in its
plan and construction to most of those erected by the Irish
chiefs in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and consisted
of a lofty square tower or keep, to which were attached the
domestic offices, all which were surrounded by out-works
enclosing an ample bawn, and flanked by small circular
towers at their angles. In its general character, therefore,
Ross Castle has no peculiar features worthy of notice; and its
chief interest is derived from its situation, which is of the
most striking beauty, commanding the richest scenery of the
lower lake, and its wooded isles, shores, and mountains. It is
situated on the east shore of the lower lake, upon the
narrow neck of the Ross or peninsula from which it derives its
name, and which, by an artificial cut through a morass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
across which a small bridge is thrown, has been converted
into an island. Neither the date of the erection of this castle
nor the name of its founder has been preserved; but its
architectural style will not allow us to suppose it much older
than the early part of the fifteenth century, and history shows
that it was for a considerable period the residence of the
illustrious family of O’Donoghoe, hereditary chiefs of the territory
called the Eoganacht, or Onaght of Lough Lein, or the
present lower lake of Killarney.</p>

<p>The great antiquity and dignity of the family of O’Donoghoe
still lives in the popular legends of the people, and is abundantly
proved, by the Irish annals and genealogies. In an
inaugural ode which was recited by the poet Cathan O’Duinnin
at the inauguration of Teige the Generous O’Donoghoe,
in 1320, and which is still preserved in the MS. library of
Trinity College, the pedigree of the O’Donoghoes, with
their filiations, is given, through twenty-seven generations,
from Core, the son of Lughaidh King of Munster in 380, to
that time, and there is no reason to doubt its accuracy or
historic truth. Our space will not permit us to enter at any
length on the history of this illustrious family, but we may
observe, that its ancient rank is sufficiently proved by the
fact, as stated in the Annals of Inisfallin, that their ancestor
Donnell, the son of Duvdavoran, was the second in command
of the Eugenian forces at the memorable battle of Clontarf,
and that shortly after that conflict he contested the sovereignty
of Desmond or South Munster with its king, and slew him
in battle.</p>

<p>In subsequent ages the family of O’Donoghoe split into three
great branches; that of O’Donoghoe More, or the great, of
which Ross Castle became the residence; O’Donoghoe of the
Glens; and O’Donoghoe of Lough Lein. Of these three families
the first and last are supposed to be extinct, and are at
least reduced to poverty; but that of the Glens is still represented
by O’Donoghoe of Killarney, who is consequently the
reputed chief of this illustrious family. By a happy chance,
very rare in Ireland, O’Donoghoe, who is as yet a minor, possesses
a considerable portion of the estates of his ancestors
of the Glens; but the properly of the O’Donoghoe More, or
Ross, as well as that of the O’Donoghoe of Lough Lein, has been
long in the possession of the noble house of Kenmare, of which
their ancestor Sir Valentine Brown made a purchase from
Donald M’Carty More, Earl of Clancarthy, as early as the year
1588, it having been forfeited by Rory O’Donoghoe More some
time previously. These lands, as Dr Smith acquaints us, were
subsequently confirmed to the grandson of the first purchaser,
Valentine, son of Nicholas Brown, by letters patent of King
James I. which passed the seal May 12, 1612, and included
with others the entire country of Onaugh, alias Onaught
O’Donoghoe More, in the county of Desmond, in which were
contained the manor and lake of the Castle of Ross, with
divers islands in Lough Lein, with all other his estate, containing
82 quarters of land, amounting to 6560 acres, besides
the fishings belonging to the manor of Ross-I-Donoghoe, all
which premises came to the family by immediate bargain and
grant from the Earl of Clancarthy, by the indenture before
mentioned. “But,” as Smith adds, “some question being
made of the validity of this grant from the crown, the king,
by privy seal, dated at Greenwich, 28th May 1618, directed
Sir Oliver St John, lord-deputy, to accept a surrender thereof
from him [Valentine], and to re-grant the same to him in fee
by a new patent, for clearing all doubt, and the better settlement
of his estate.”</p>

<p>But though the lands of O’Donoghoe More have passed
away from his race, he still retains possession of the waters:
and, though dead himself corporeally, he still lives, and governs
spiritually in his ancient principality. If, reader, you
doubt the truth of our statement, ask the people of the lakes,
and they will at once remove your scepticism. They will tell
you that he frequently appears to them on May-day, on a
milk-white horse, gliding over the glassy lake to the sound of
unearthly music, and attended by troops of spirits scattering
spring flowers. They differ, indeed, a good deal in their accounts
of the appearance of their ancient lord. Derrick, in his
amusing Letters on Killarney, written in 1760, tells us that
he was assured, when O’Donoghoe revisits his friends, which
is every May morning before sunrise, he is “attended by
an incredible number of followers, wrestling, hurling, and
playing football upon the surface of the lake, which affords
them as sure footing as the solid earth.” And Derrick’s
friend, Mr Ockenden, whose letters descriptive of Killarney
are printed in the same volume, describes O’Donoghoe’s horse
not as a white but a black one. As this gentleman’s account
of O’Donoghoe’s visits is the most minute, as well as the
earliest, that we have seen, we are tempted to give it in full.</p>

<p>“There lived in the largest island (for there are several
islands on the lake) many hundred years ago, a petty prince,
named O’Donoghoe, who was lord of the whole lake, the surrounding
shore, and a large district of neighbouring country.
He manifested, during his stay upon earth, great munificence,
great humanity, and great wisdom; for, by his profound
knowledge in all the secret powers of nature, he wrought
wonders as miraculous as any tradition has recorded of
saints by the aid of angels, or of sorcerers by the assistance
of demons; and among many other most astonishing performances
he rendered his person immortal. After having
continued a long time upon the surface of the globe without
growing old, he one day, at Ross Castle (the place where he
most usually resided), took leave of his friends, and rising
from the floor, like some aërial existence, passed through the
window, shot away horizontally to a considerable distance
from the castle, and then descended. The water unfolding
at his approach, gave him entrance down to the subaqueous
regions, and then, to the inexpressible astonishment of all
beholders, closed over his head, as they believed, for ever: but
in this they were mistaken.</p>

<p>He returned again some years after, revisiting, not, like
Hamlet’s ghost, ‘the glimpses of the moon making night
hideous,’ but the radiance of the sun making day joyful, to
those at least who saw him: since which time he has continued
to make very frequent expeditions to these upper
regions, sometimes three or four in a year; but sometimes
three or four years pass without his once appearing, which
the bordering inhabitants have always looked on as a mark
of very bad times.</p>

<p>It was feared this would be the third year he would
suffer to elapse without his once cheering their eyes with
his presence: but at the latter end of last August he again
appeared, to the inexpressible joy of all, and was seen by
numbers in the middle of the day. I had the curiosity, before
I left Killarney, to visit one of the witnesses to this
very marvellous fact.</p>

<p>The account she gives is, that returning with a kinswoman
to her house at the head of the lake, they both beheld a fine
gentleman, mounted upon a black horse, ascend through the
water with a numerous retinue on foot, who all moved
together along the surface towards a small island, near which
they again descended under water. This account is confirmed,
in time, place, and circumstances, by many more
spectators from the side of the lake, who are all ready to
swear, and not improbably to suffer death, in support of their
testimony.</p>

<p>His approach is sometimes preceded by music inconceivably
harmonious; sometimes by thunder inexpressibly loud;
but oftenest without any warning whatsoever. He always rises
through the surface of the lake, and generally amuses himself
upon it, but not constantly: for there is a farmer now
alive, who declares, as I am told, that riding one evening near
the lower end of the lake, he was overtaken by a gentleman
who seemed under thirty years of age, very handsome in his
person, very sumptuous in his apparel, and very affable in his
conversation. After having travelled for some time together,
the nobleman (for such he judged him to be by his appearance)
observed, that as night was approaching, the town far off,
and lodging not easy to be found, he should be welcome to
take a bed that night at his house, which, he said, was not
very distant.</p>

<p>The invitation was readily accepted; they approached the
lake together, and both their horses moved upon the surface
without sinking, to the infinite amazement of the farmer, who
thence perceived the stranger to be no less than the great
O’Donoghoe. They rode a considerable distance from shore,
and then, descending into a delightful country under water,
lay that night in a house much larger in size and much more
richly furnished than even Lord Kenmare’s at Killarney.”</p>

<p>With respect, however, to the colour of O’Donoghoe’s horse,
the prevailing belief seems now to be, that it is a white one,
and this notion has been adopted by our national bard,
Moore, in his beautiful song called “O’Donoghoe’s Mistress,”
which, as he informs us, is founded on one among other stories
connected with this legend of the lakes, and in which it is
said that there was a young and beautiful girl, whose imagination
was so impressed with the idea of this visionary chieftain,
that she fancied herself in love with him, and at last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
in a fit of insanity, on a May morning, threw herself into the
lake. But we had better give the song itself:&mdash;</p>

<p>But we have been attracted by this phantom chief too long
from our immediate subject, and we must now return to it.
From the historical notices of Ross Castle, as collected by
the historian of Kerry, it will be seen that it was of old a
place of some strength and importance, and that its possession
was not to be acquired without expense and trouble. In his
description of Ross island, published in 1756, Dr Smith states
that “on it stands an ancient castle, formerly the seat of
O’Donoghoe Ross, which hath a new barrack adjoining to it.
This place hath been for some years past a military garrison,
having a governor appointed for it upon the establishment.
Before the castle are a few dismounted iron guns, which give
it something the air of a fortification. The castle had been
flanked with round turrets, which together with its situation
rendered it a place of some strength. In the wars of 1641,
it surrendered to Ludlow, who was attended in the expedition
by Lord Broughil and Sir Hardress Waller, and was the
last place that held out in Munster against the English parliament.”</p>

<p>This surrender followed the decisive battle of Knockinclashy,
in the county of Cork, in 1652, fought by the Lord
Broughil on the English side, and the Lord Muskerry on that
of the Irish, after which the latter retreated into Ross Castle,
and was followed thither by Ludlow, who, with 4000 foot and
200 horse, laid siege to the castle. The subsequent proceedings
are thus described by Ludlow himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In this expedition I was accompanied by the Lord Broughil,
and Sir Hardress Waller, major-general of the foot. Being arrived
at this place, I was informed that the enemy received continual
supplies from those parts that lay on the other side, and
were covered with woods and mountains; whereupon I sent a
party of two thousand foot to clear those woods, and to find out
some convenient place for erecting a fort, if there should be
occasion. These forces met with some opposition, but at last
they routed the enemy, killing some, and taking others prisoners:
the rest saved themselves by their good footmanship.
Whilst this was doing, I employed that part of the army which
was with me in fortifying a neck of land, where I designed to
leave a party to keep in the Irish on this side, that I might be
at liberty, with the greater part of the horse and foot, to look
after the enemy abroad, and to receive and convoy such boats
and other things necessary as the commissioners sent us by
sea. When we had received our boats, each of which was
capable of containing one hundred and twenty men, I ordered
one of them to be rowed about the water, in order to find out
the most convenient place for landing upon the enemy; which
they perceiving, thought fit, by a timely submission, to prevent
the danger that threatened them; and having expressed their
desires to that purpose, commissioners were appointed on
both sides to treat.”</p>

<p>After a fortnight’s debate, says Ludlow, articles were
agreed upon and ratified on both sides; and the son of the
Lord Muskerry and Sir Daniel O’Brien were delivered up as
hostages for the performance of the treaty; in consequence
of which, about 5000 Irish, horse and foot, laid down their
arms and delivered up their horses, and thus terminated the
hostilities in Munster.</p>

<p>Smith, in his History of Kerry, tells us that “a man whose
name was Hopkins, and who a few years ago was sexton of
Swords, near Dublin, was present at the taking and surrender
of this place, and assisted in drawing the above-mentioned
vessel into the lake. The Irish,” he adds, “had a kind of
prophecy among them, that Ross Castle could not be taken
until a ship should swim upon the lake; and the appearance
of this vessel contributed not a little to intimidate the garrison,
and to hasten the capitulation. The said Hopkins lived
to the age of one hundred and fifteen years, and died at
Swords.”</p>

<p>We have already stated that a barrack was erected in
connection with the castle in the commencement of the last
century, and a small garrison was kept here till a few years
ago. These hideous barracks, as Sir R. C. Hoare called them,
were a dreadful eye-sore to all the lovers of the picturesque who
visited the Killarney lakes; but Ireland seems no longer to
require such structures, and the barrack of Ross Castle has
been some time dismantled, and its ivied walls now contribute
to the picturesqueness of the parent fortress.</p>

<p class="right">P.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">EDUCATION OF YOUTH.</h2>

<p>Action of both mind and body ought to be so continued as
to serve as relaxation to each other. The mind of a man, still
more of a child, is incapable of long perseverance in mental
exertion. This is a generally acknowledged truth, to which
I shall add one more to the same purpose, which is less known.
Young men, and those who are not advanced in years, if
healthy and of warm constitutions, are never very greatly
inclined to mental exertion till their bodies are to a certain
degree fatigued, I do not say wholly exhausted. Till this
fatigue is produced, their body has a preponderance over
the mind, and in this case it is a truly natural want, which
cannot easily be silenced. Each muscle requires exertion,
and the whole machine strives to employ its powers; this is
vulgarly called to have no sit-still flesh. If the fatigue be
once brought on, the call for bodily exertion is stilled; the
mind is no longer disturbed by it, and all its labours are
facilitated. Our common mode of education pays no regard
to this: youths appear in school to be strengthened by sleep
and food, and too frequently, alas! thrown into an unnatural
heat and commotion. How is it possible to fix the attention
under such circumstances? The body requires action; if
this be not allowed, it will obtain it in silence; it will act upon
the passions, and, above all, the fiery temperament of youth
will influence the imagination. Thus attention slumbers.
We are barbarous when we attempt to awaken it with the
rod; we require from innocent children what is unnatural;
we inflict pain on the body to prevent its action; yet
activity was bestowed on it by its creator; yet nature renovates
this activity every night; the mind is soon carried
away by the whirlwind of corporal energies, and lost in the
realm of chimeras. To facilitate the contemplation of them,
I shall just repeat the desirable parallel between the qualities
of the body and mind:&mdash;Health of body&mdash;serenity of mind&mdash;hardiness&mdash;manliness
of sentiment&mdash;strength and address&mdash;presence
of mind and courage&mdash;activity of body&mdash;activity of
mind&mdash;excellence of form&mdash;mental beauty&mdash;acuteness of the
senses&mdash;strength of understanding.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Medicus.</span></p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Ancient Music.</span>&mdash;The Egyptian flute was only a cow’s
horn with three or four holes in it, and their harp or lyre had
only three strings; the Grecian lyre had only seven strings,
and was very small, being held in one hand; the Jewish trumpets,
that made the walls of Jericho fall down, were only
rams’ horns. Their flute was the same as the Egyptian; they
had no other instrumental music but by percussion, of which
the greatest boast was the psaltery, a small triangular harp
or lyre with wire strings, and struck with an iron needle or
stick; their sacbut was something like a bagpipe; the timbrel
was a tambourine, and the dulcimer was a horizontal harp,
with wire strings, and struck with a stick like the psaltery.
They had no written music; had scarcely a vowel in their
language, and yet, according to Josephus, had two hundred
thousand musicians playing at the dedication of the Temple of
Solomon. Mozart would have died in such a concert in the
greatest agonies.&mdash;<cite>Dr Burney’s History of Music.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">The River St John, in New Brunswick.</span>&mdash;In this river
there are several falls, not downwards, as in the ordinary
course of rivers, but upwards against the current. The
River St John is of the size of the Rhine. It drains a large
portion of the province of New Brunswick. The mass of
water it discharges into the Bay of Fundy is prodigious, especially
during the spring floods, when the tides rise to the
height of 35, 50, and sometimes even 60 feet, above the ordinary
level. The remarkable fall of the water backwards is
produced by the enormous volume of water, occupying a channel
in some places ten miles in breadth, being confined near
St John’s into a breadth of 300 yards, which occasions it to
roll back impetuously in the form of a magnificent cascade.</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Children of the Poor.</span>&mdash;Charles Lamb has truly and
touchingly remarked, that common people’s children “are
dragged up, not brought up.” There is a precocity&mdash;not,
indeed, of intellect, but of prudence and worldly wisdom&mdash;in
them, that is truly painful. Care has usurped the empire of
carelessness, that legitimate monarch of a child’s being; and
like all usurpers, has in the vehemence of his achievements
anticipated the slow march of Time. Life itself, which among
the children of the rich is an exuberant overflowing, that,
lavish it as they may, still seems inexhaustible, among those
of the poor is a lean phantom, grasped at with pain and maintained
with a struggle; in short, they know nothing of youth
but its feebleness and its wailing; its bloom and its buoyancy
being, like every other luxury, beyond their reach. To me
the most painful sight in this world is a poor, that is, a destitute
child. Whatever misery a grown-up person may be
plunged into, a thousand suppositions are left for its palliation:
they may once have been well off, or they may have been the
artificers of their own ruin, and they may live to see better
days: but children&mdash;they can have done nothing to deserve
that the one blessing unmortgaged at the Fall, the carelessness
of youth, should be taken from them.&mdash;<cite>Lady Bulwer.</cite></p>

<h2 class="gap4">THE DECAYED OLD GENTLEMAN,<br />
<span class="smaller">A SKETCH.</span></h2>

<p>There is something very touching about this character&mdash;something
in his mild tone of speech, in his polite and gentle
demeanour, that at once engages our sympathies. We
have the poor old gentleman distinctly before our mind’s eye
at this moment. Let us endeavour to sketch him.</p>

<p>He is of middle height, well proportioned, and of rather
slender make. His clothes, though a good deal the worse
for wear, are carefully brushed, and put on with scrupulous
neatness. His linens are clean and bright, and his neck-cloth,
equally faultless, is adjusted with nice precision; for,
old as he is, he has not lost, nor ever will lose, that sense of
propriety which dictates a decent attention to external appearance.</p>

<p>Some sixty and odd summers have passed over the head of
him who is the subject of our sketch, and they have left their
usual traces behind. His hair is thin and scanty, and of the
silvery hue of eild. His countenance is expressive at once of
a gentle and benevolent nature, of a cultivated mind and refined
taste. He has seen much, read much, and thought
more. A certain air of mild, subdued dignity&mdash;for the old
man, poor though he be, never for a moment forgets that
he <em>is</em> a gentleman&mdash;adds a grace to all he says and does.
When in society, or when accosted by a friend, a pleasant
smile, speaking a sincere affability, plays on his cheerful
countenance. But when alone, when there is no one present
to demand the exercise of his politeness, the expression of that
countenance subsides into a gentle melancholy. His look is
then grave and thoughtful; somewhat sad, but not morose.
There has been disappointment in his life, high hopes laid
low, and noble aspirations foiled in their aim.</p>

<p>Delightful it is to see the old gentleman enter a room in
which some friends are assembled&mdash;his bow is so graceful&mdash;his
smile so cheerful&mdash;his words of greeting so pleasant to
the ear. All rise, smiling, to receive him&mdash;all hail his presence,
with a quiet but heartfelt joy. Welcome, thrice welcome
is he to all. His gentle manners, his exhaustless store of
anecdote, all so well selected, all so neatly told. His intelligence
and extensive information render him one of the most
delightful of companions. A welcome visitor is he at all
times&mdash;a welcome addition to the family circle into which it
is his delight to drop, just in time to share in the sober,
social cup of tea, his favourite beverage.</p>

<p>The old gentleman is unmarried&mdash;he is a bachelor. There
is some vague unconnected story of an early attachment and
of disappointed love, but nobody knows any of the particulars&mdash;no
one knows who the lady was, nor what were the
circumstances of the case; and our old friend never alludes
to them in the most distant manner. The history of this passage
in his life is a secret pent up within his own breast;
one that will go with him to the grave, and with him be
buried within its silent precincts. But it is one over which
he often broods in the solitude of his solitary chamber, and
during those sleepless nights, and they are many, when reminiscences
of the past forbid the approach of forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Being a bachelor, and his circumstances narrow&mdash;a small
annuity being now his only dependence&mdash;our old friend has no
house of his own. He lives in hired lodgings&mdash;humble, but
cleanly, comfortable and respectable. His landlady is a
“decent widow,” and he has been her lodger for fifteen years.
Little as he has, he has always paid her punctually, and to the
last farthing; and much does she esteem and respect her kind
and gentlemanly inmate. Regular and temperate in all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
habits, and moderate in his desires, he gives her little
trouble, and even that little he is at all times anxious to
abridge. His cup of tea or coffee morning and evening is
nearly all in the way of cookery that he requires at her hands.
Quietly he comes in and quietly he goes out, and he never
does either without saying something kind or civil as he passes.
In all things easily pleased, he expresses thanks for every
little attention shown him, and never raises his voice in anger,
never even in querulousness or impatience. To every one
around him, without distinction of rank or worldly circumstances,
he is all politeness, all gentleness, and all kindness.</p>

<p>Who can but love and respect the decayed old gentleman!</p>

<h2 class="gap4">THE ITALIAN ORGAN BOY.</h2>

<h3>PART FIRST.</h3>

<p>The streets of a great city, whether swept by the tumultuous
tide of life by day, or echoing only to the dull and solitary
tread of the patrol by night, are never devoid of material for
interesting remark or rumination to such as are so disposed.
He must, indeed, be a man of sluggish sensibilities and slender
fancy who could traverse any of our great thoroughfares
without finding them occasionally touched by some of the
thousand little tales of anxiety or satisfaction, mourning or
merriment, legible in brief upon the faces of the motley and
many-featured throng around him, or at least, by the supplemental
aid of a little imagination, plausibly constructed from
the elements thereby supplied. There is perhaps no period
so well fitted for these studies of life, as it is in its private and
more important aspect, as the close of one of our short and
busy winter days, when the pressure of diurnal toil is removed
from men’s minds, whether its effect has been to sway them
from the contemplation of joy or wretchedness, and unbiassed
they are left to imprint their character on the countenance of
each. When does cheerfulness appear so undiluted as when
a long winter evening’s recreation spreads out before it,
whether spent within the mellowed glow of a happy domestic
hearth, with all its easy, pure, and unsuspicious pleasures, or
in the social reunion with its friendly, careless, and unclouded
gaiety? and when does wretchedness feel so blank and dismal
as when a weary length of dim and rayless hours gives space
for all its melancholy broodings, undiverted by occupation,
unmitigated by that spirit of hope which more or less mingles
with the temperament of all by day, as if a constituent of the
glad light of heaven in which we then live and move? A
cursory reading of the countenance of each passer by will at
this hour give the poorest physiognomist no inaccurate notion
of the complexion of his domestic lot; and, selecting an individual
from the homeward-wending crowd, I often form my
speculation as to the scene that awaits him, follow him in the
freedom of all-privileged and all-pervading thought across
the threshold of his abode, conjure up the circumstances of
his reception, glance through the perspective of his evening
arrangements, and, as I find them agreeable or the reverse,
extend or curtail my domiciliary inspection.</p>

<p>During a recent winter, on one of its most cheerless evenings,
I was thus exercising my discernment and my fancy in
a long homeward walk through the centre of the city, and
mentally apportioning to each that attracted my eye the
share of satisfaction or discomfort that lay before him&mdash;my
own mind subject to the lights and shadows, the glow and
chill, which in various degrees were suggested as the lot of
each. It was precisely the evening to lend the keenest zest
to the happiness of the light-hearted, and a more poignant
bitterness to the misery of the unfortunate. A cold icy
wind whistled shrilly through every narrow street and entry
as I passed it, and swept more boldly down the wider spaces,
bearing, occasionally, slanting showers of sleet, which a glance
at the dun and overcharged canopy of snow-clouds and of
smoke above showed to be but premonitory intimations of a
heavy and continuous fall. For the most part, all below was
impatient motion and occupied expectation, because almost all
had a goal in view to which they hastened, the fierce inclemency
of the weather impelling alike the mirthful and the
melancholy onward. The well-fed, well-defended passenger,
with muffled neck and arms thrust to the elbow in the pockets
of his dreadnought, rubbed shoulders with the half-paralyzed
and shivering wretch that shuffled amid the hurrying throng,
often apparently without other object than that of joining in
the stream of fellow-creatures, whom he could resemble in
no other way. Carriage after carriage rolled past, the children
of affluence for their tenants, interchanging careless comments,
or looking with languid and heedless gaze upon the
squalid, the impoverished, the abandoned, the degraded, that,
alas! met the eye so often as to account for, and almost
justify, the indifference displayed.</p>

<p>“What a collocation, not merely of the extremes of human
condition, but of almost every interposed gradation!” thought
I, as, sated with the multiform instances presented in the concourse,
and half bewildered with the medley of sights and
sounds&mdash;the glittering ostentation of the glaring shops, the
hum and tramp of the jostling crowd, the din and rattle of
ceaseless vehicles, from the lumbering dray to the elastic carriage,
the oft-mingled appeal of importunate mendicants, and,
not least confounding, the sleet-laden and staggering blasts
that met me with wild caprice at almost every corner&mdash;I
gladly turned aside into a more sheltered and less frequented
street, to pursue a route of greater ease, though at the expense
of a greater circuit. But misery in the aggregate can
generally be encountered with less disturbance than when
submitted to in the case of solitary sufferers; and before I had
proceeded half the length of a private and comparatively
deserted street, I had more effective calls upon my charity&mdash;there
was at that time no legal provision for the necessitous&mdash;than
when passing among the abounding instances of destitution
I had just witnessed. My stock of small change, and I
must add, co-equally therewith, that of my patience too, was
nearly exhausted, when my eye fell upon the figure of a young
lad, who stood indifferently sheltered from the wind under the
projected doorway of an uninhabited house. I had made up
my mind to the customary solicitation: but he seemed so abstracted
as not to notice my approach, and, pitying the forlorn
looking youth, and wondering at his forbearance, I walked
slowly past, to give him an opportunity. I found him to be
an organ-player, for the instrument, unslung from his shoulders,
rested upon the flag at his feet, and a brief notice of his
collapsed but characteristic features showed him to be an
Italian. A shivering marmoset, partly covered by his jacket,
was lodged on the hollow of one arm, while the other, resting
on his raised knee, supported his head, as, unconscious of my
proximity and observation, he gazed fixedly upon the ground.
The sight of mute personal privation and friendless loneliness
would at such a crisis have been influential enough to stir up
whatever humanity one had, but when witnessed in a stranger
from a far land, in one, too, nurtured under the sapphire
skies and blissful clime of Italy, and withering now by a dismal
change beneath such dense and murky clouds, and such
a pitiless and scourging breeze, the demand on one’s kindly
offices was irresistible, and, drawing near to the desolate lad,
I accompanied a small gift with a few words in his own most
musical and thrilling tongue. He started from his musing
posture as the electric syllables struck upon his ear, and, as
he gazed with keen enthusiasm upon me, the blood mantled
vividly upon his chilled and weather-wrinkled cheek, while
with grateful but melancholy earnestness he poured out his
thanks. There was something to me unusually touching in
the aspect of the friendless young foreigner, as well as in the
circumstances in which I found him. He had a cast of thought
and maturity in his face which hardship, isolation, and self-dependence,
seemed to have anticipated years in producing;
for his slender and stripling figure, and the unshaven down
upon his lip, bespoke him still in an early stage of youth.
After a word or two of compassion, I passed on. But his
dashed and disappointed look at separation followed me: my
conscience chid me for resting in a cold gratuity to one so
dejected, yet so sensitive to relief&mdash;a spring of gladness for
whom my acquaintance with his native language, it appeared,
could so easily unseal.</p>

<p>He was a stranger, weary, friendless, cheerless, and necessitous&mdash;unsusceptible
of those mitigations of suffering which
even the poorest experience among their own people and their
own kindred. I was hastening to my unshared, ’tis true, but
far, therefore, from joyless lodgings, an abundant board, a
radiant fire, a storm and snow proof apartment, furnished
with all the appliances of comfort which winter covets; and
would they be diminished by the admission of this homeless,
and, from his countenance, I dare certify, guileless wanderer,
to share for a time their influence? No. I have it in my
power to interpose one bright spot in his life of hardship and
privation, to suspend for a while the yearnings with which
doubtless, at this hour of dreariness and suffering, he turns
in thought to the scenes of his but recent childhood in his
own lovely land, to the sunny azure skies the joyous vine-clad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
hills, the playmates that even now, perhaps, at the close
of a bright and genial day, are clustering in merry meeting for
the evening song and dance, his father’s cottage, his mother’s
caress. “Yes, I will turn back,” exclaimed I, “and enable
him, if ever he rejoin the social circle in his own ardent home,
to tell his eager listeners a trait of kindness and sympathy
shared in the far off frigid country of the north.” As I concluded,
I again stood before him, as with a shiver and a sigh
the poor lad was about raising his organ upon his shoulder
again; and, telling him that I had been in and loved the land
from which he came, that I was fond of its people, and of their
music too, and wished to talk with and hear him play at leisure
and in comfort by my own fireside, asked him to accompany
me to it. A smile of gladness lighted up his pale
expressive face as he gratefully declared his readiness; and
a car passing at the moment, I hailed it, and in a few seconds,
young Carlo Girardi&mdash;for that he told me was his name&mdash;his
chattering and half perished marmoset, his muffled
music mill, and my enlivened and approving self, were rattling
rapidly to my lodgings. I found him a fine, intelligent, unhacknied
lad, to whose fervid heart my partial knowledge of
his native tongue secured me ready access; and, after cold
and hunger had given way to fire and food, I experienced no
difficulty in drawing from him an ingenuous and vivid narration
of his personal story&mdash;one so singular and romantic in
its character, and so illustrative of the purest impulses of the
human heart, as to merit a repetition better than many a
more highly wrought and complex tale. Cleared of the circumlocution
caused by his indifferent stock of English, and
converted into a dialect more uniform and familiar to our
ears, it ran substantially thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I come from the neighbourhood of the little village of
Montanio, at the foot of the great Appennines. My father was,
and I pray is still, a small vine-grower and gardener, supplying
the market of Telese, and other towns within reach, with
fruits, flowers, and vegetables. We were a family of five&mdash;my
father, my dear mother, my elder and only brother
Ludovico, my beautiful and gentle sister Bianca, and myself;”
and his tone grew touchingly tremulous, as, in connection with
his cottage home, he went over the old, familiar, household
names. “Oh, that I was ever called upon to leave them to
wander, unfriended and unknown, among rough and careless
strangers, to forsake all pleasant things, the gay and glad
green fields, the sunny hills, the sparkling mountain streams,
the flowered and fruited gardens, and the ever bright and
beautiful sky which stretched its unclouded azure overhead,
for this cold and shivering, this dim and misty land! But yet I
would do as much again, if such a call again were made upon
me&mdash;dark shame upon me if I hesitated!&mdash;and when I return
to them once more&mdash;and oh, may heaven grant that now I
shortly may!&mdash;I will look with the greater rapture upon all I
left, upon beauties and on blessings I then too little, far too
little, cared for. My father was ever kind to us when we
were in the way of obedience to his wishes and ideas of duty,
but rigid and severe to resent every error we might commit.
I have heard the elder neighbours say that in his own young
days he had been wild and perverse, and entangled thereby in
many troubles, and that, therefore, in affection and providence
for us, he was the more exact in our care and education. I was
too young to be much in the way of following my own bent, and
so had little opportunity of offending him; but my brother
Ludovico, who was hot, daring, and adventurous, was often
led to look for wild and irregular excitement with the roving
hunters and rude shepherds from the mountains above, and
his mingling in their lawless society always raised my father’s
resentment, and, despite my mother’s exerted influence, often
brought disquiet and disunion among us. But though reckless
and unsettled, Ludovico was ever frank, winsome, and
honest-hearted, which, however, could not save him from
sharing in the evil fame of his companions; and though his
handsome figure, open temper, and ready offices for all who
sought them, made him a favourite with the young, yet the
elder looked grave and severe upon him, as one already committed
in the road to ruin. Our sister Bianca, who, not in
our eyes only, was the sweetest and prettiest maiden within
the circle of a league, drew to herself, as she grew up, the
admiring looks of all; and at our gay village festivals, at the
sowing, vintage, and noted holidays, he was a happy and
envied youth who could oftenest engage her hand for the tarantula,
or follow her voice upon the mandoline. But the one
who paid his court with most success was Francesco, the only
son of Marcolini the wealthy miller, who was by far the
richest man in our community. But when his son’s courtship
became known to him, he forthwith fell into a rage at the
notion of so imprudent a match, for he was a purse-proud
man, who valued his gold above most other things, above the
beauty and innocence of our Bianca, and the pledged affection
of Francesco, for whom he looked far above us humble
people for a more equally dowered bride. Resolute to extinguish
his folly as he called it, at once, he solemnly vowed
to cut him off with a carlino, if he pursued his thriftless project;
and, not assured that even this would deter him, he determined
to engage, likewise, the authority of my father,
whose strict and unswerving character was well known to
him, and accordingly besought him to lay his prohibition upon
Bianca. My father, who would have scorned to force a thus
forbidden union, hurried to comply with his wishes; and in
Bianca’s obedience there was found a surer safeguard than
in Francesco’s fear of poverty, as, even in defiance of his
father’s menace, he vehemently urged my sister to become
his, and trust to the labour of his hands for their maintenance.
But my father’s injunctions were habitually paramount;
and poor Francesco, finding her hesitation not to be
overcome, soon fell into despair and declining health. He became
melancholy, faint-hearted, and neglectful of all his old
occupations; and his strange and moody habits, quenched
spirits, and fast failing strength, so wrought upon his father’s
fear and affection, that he began to think it better to make
some compromise, and forego a little of his ambition rather than
endanger Francesco’s life. In consequence, he intimated to
my father that on reflection he was disposed to forward the
marriage, provided a certain sum, which he named, was
settled upon Bianca, as it was scarcely to be expected, he
urged, that he would give his son and the heir of all his money
to a portionless bride. My father acknowledged his request
to be but natural, but professed at once the insufficiency of his
means to satisfy it without impoverishing the rest of his
family; an act which, however devoted to the happiness of
his daughter, conscience would not allow him to commit.</p>

<p>Old Martolini, finding him intractable upon the point,
proposed then, that as Bianca and Francesco were still very
young, their marriage should be postponed for at least three
years, at the end of which time, if he were prepared to give
her a certain portion&mdash;making a large abatement from his first
demand&mdash;it might with his consent take place. But, exasperated
at his disappointment and forced concession, he added
a passionate oath, that on no other terms would he hear of
the connection, even though his son Francesco were such a
fool as to pine till it brought him to his death-bed. My
father, balanced between his anxiety to close an arrangement
so beneficial to Bianca, and his sense of the hardships
and extreme frugality it would necessarily impose upon us all
during the interval, desired a short time to make his decision.
The same evening he called all of us, except my
sister, to him&mdash;declared the proposal of Francesco’s father&mdash;asked
our opinion separately upon it&mdash;and when with one
voice we all professed our readiness, our eagerness, to undergo
any and every additional labour and privation that might
take a tear from our gentle Bianca’s eye, or add a blush or a
smile to her now pallid cheek and lips, he answered, “It is
just spoken as I would have you speak, my dear wife and
children: but saying is easy, doing difficult. Three years
will give you many opportunities of proving this, for there
must be much denial, frugality, and toil, brief nights and
long and busy days, to enable us to accumulate within
the time a sum so ill proportioned to our means.” Bianca
was then informed of the arrangement, and smiles of rekindled
hope and rapture mingled with tears of grateful love
and sensibility; and her rapidly returning bloom and gaiety
gilded every thing around with its own gladness, and rendered
our ruder and scantier fare and more lengthened labour pleasanter
at times than the merry meeting and the music, which
we could now of course but rarely join. The impulse of affection
for dear Bianca was strong in every heart, and this,
with the prospect of a happy completion of our undertaking,
almost changed every sacrifice into a delight. But, young
though I be, I have now lived long enough to know, that as
the brightest morning sky is often overcast before the close
of day, so are our most shining hopes subject to many a
cloud and chill before, if ever, they attain to their fulfilment.”
(Here poor Carlo paused for a moment in his narrative;
and with your leave, gentle reader, I too shall rest,
till I have the pleasure of meeting you again in next week’s
Journal.)</p>

<h2 class="gap4">ON STIMULANTS.</h2>

<h3>TOBACCO.</h3>

<p>Repose is the remedy which nature points out to tired mortals
when exhausted either by mental or bodily fatigue. This
is her prescription for refreshing man’s animal spirits, and
enabling him to resume his labours. Stimulants are by no
means congenial with her methods or her processes. They
are like whip and spur to the weary steed; they may force
him on indeed, but it is at the expense of his constitution and
his powers. In medical science, the great art, as the doctors
say, is to assist nature; and with this view, the skilful practitioner
will sometimes order stimulants, and find them doubtless
highly useful to his patient; but their habitual use is no
maxim of the healing art, but much rather that of the destroying
or disabling one, if I may use the expression. By
the way, we are sadly prone to habits, and therefore it
“stands us upon,” in a most serious degree, to consider well
the nature and probable results of any custom before we
adopt it. In this astute and intellectual age of ours it has
been discovered that it is much easier to abstain altogether
from a dangerous indulgence than to adhere strictly to moderation,
and temperance has been superseded by teetotalism;
and I would just add to this, by way of corollary, that
it is much easier to slide into a bad habit than to get rid
of it again. But to return to our theme. The effects produced
by stimulants are all agreeable for the moment. Wine
and opium raise men above earth and all its cares; and so
long as the stimulant lasts, they sit as it were at the supper
of the gods. Anacreon is then the only ballad-monger, and
with him each is ready to sing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Strew me a breathing bed of leaves,</div>
<div class="verse">Where lotus with the myrtle weaves;</div>
<div class="verse">And while in luxury’s dream I sink,</div>
<div class="verse">Let me the balm of Bacchus drink!</div>
<div class="verse">In this delicious hour of joy,</div>
<div class="verse">Young Love shall be my goblet-boy,</div>
<div class="verse">Folding his little golden vest,</div>
<div class="verse">With cinctures, round his snowy breast;</div>
<div class="verse">Himself shall hover by my side,</div>
<div class="verse">And minister the racy tide!</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But when the influence of the spell is over, immediately they
sink down as much below the level of ordinary mortals, as
they were before raised above it. For a delightful exhilaration
of body and mind, they now experience a sad reverse, in which
they find much more pleasing music in the prudent advice of
the apothecary, than in all the Odes of Anacreon. The cry
is not then,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Let us drain the nectar’d bowl,</div>
<div class="verse">Let us raise the song of soul&mdash;&amp;c.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Let us drain the <em>saline dose</em>,</div>
<div class="verse">Let’s expel these humours gross.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, though poets have favoured us with many a canto on
the raptures inspired by flowing bowls and sparkling goblets,
they have rarely condescended to give us one line, if it were
only by way of note, on the “state of the stomach” on the
morning after one of those “nights and suppers of the gods.”
Such a detail indeed was never intended for the divine art of
poesy. It is a job not at all calculated for the lover of agreeable
fiction, and hence the world hears little on the subject. Those
after-reckonings are nevertheless serious, though unpalatable
things. Pleasure here acts much like a tavern host, who remembers
most accurately all the good things he provides,
though his guests are both apt and willing to forget them.
Every item is carefully put down, and must be paid for. I
shall only say, that fortunate is he who takes warning in
time. I might moralise on this theme in good set phrase,
but the ground has been so well and so frequently beaten by
others, that I forbear. With respect to such articles as
opium and spirits, the “spirit of the age,” as I have already
intimated, runs quite in an opposite direction to that
of indulgence; and it is wisely considered that as those who
can be temperate in the use of such ticklish commodities
must owe a great deal to a happy temperament of constitution,
and be few in number, whilst the greater part of mankind
are not so felicitously moulded, the rule of teetotalism, viz.,
entire abstinence, is on the whole the safest and best. But
there is one article in our pharmacopœia of stimulants, upon
which there seems to be some difference of opinion, and with
regard to which I should wish to record my humble opinion.
I allude to the nicotian leaf-tobacco.</p>

<p>Now, I regret to say that a long and attentive study of the
subject compels me to pronounce an unfavourable sentence
on this article. Whatever value it may possess as a
medicine&mdash;and that, in the present state of our knowledge, is not
much&mdash;I must say that, as an instrument of luxury in ordinary
use, it is unwholesome and injurious. To the physician
it may be satisfactory to ascertain in what way, precisely,
the injurious effect is produced; but it may suffice
others to learn from experience and observation what is the
actual result. It is obvious that tobacco causes an excitement
of the nervous system, and thus disturbs the course of
nature; but nature never is, and never can be, disturbed with
impunity. To apply a stimulus to the system for which
there is no natural demand, is to cause a waste of nervous
energy, of which nature has need for her own legitimate purposes,
and therefore to inflict an injury upon her, greater or
less according to the amount of that uncalled for expenditure.
To keep such an unnatural stimulus in constant action, is tantamount
to the creation of a constitutional derangement of
the functions, or the introduction of an actual disease into
the body; and nobody will pretend to say that this is not injurious.
To my simple apprehension, it is anti-hygeian practice
with a vengeance. I am no physician, but I believe
this to be the true theory of our subject, regarded in a physiological
point of view, and it is decisive against the nicotian
habit, however small the quantity of the article used may be.
People are rather indisposed to believe that an “agreeable”
sensation can be an “unwholesome” one; but unfortunately
for poor humanity, and the popularity of us sages, nothing in
nature is more certain than the possibility of such a conjuncture.
It is not only certain, but, alas, commonly known by
experience, that an agreeable thing may be unwholesome, and
a pleasant sensation anything at all but a symptom of healthful
action.</p>

<p>Again, people are apt to suppose that no injury is done to
their health, because they are not sensible of the wound at the
moment; but this also is a notion which we must class among
vulgar errors. It is a matter of demonstration, not merely
of hypothesis, that we may sustain most grievous injury of
which we are not instantly sensible; nay, that so long a time
may elapse after the impression has been imparted, that we
become unable to trace the effect to its cause; and yet the relation
of cause and effect stands sure, however ignorant or
unconscious we may be of it. As an illustration of this position,
I shall mention a case which came under my own observation.
I was once acquainted with a gentleman, who at
eighty years of age was what would be called a stout, healthy
old fellow. He was certainly of a most robust constitution,
and had never addicted himself to any habit “calculated to
shorten life,” as they say at the Insurance Offices, saving and
excepting that of taking snuff. Well, it has been said to me,
“See how your anti-nicotian theory is set at defiance by this
hearty old fellow. If tobacco be a slow poison, it must be,
as was said of tea, very slow indeed, or how should we have
such an exemplary octogenarian as this, ‘o’er all its ills victorious?’
He has been taking snuff all his life, and yet, you
perceive, is nothing the worse for it.” Now, I did not perceive
any such thing, but was well aware that the contrary
was the case. I was of opinion, and am now fully
convinced of the fact, that he suffered extremely, nay, intensely,
from the habit, without himself or others being at all
aware of it. I do not speak of a nose and face perpetually
begrimed with snuff&mdash;of a waistcoat and inexpressibles embrowned
and powdered all over with it&mdash;of the expenditure of
pocket-handkerchiefs, and waste of time in nose-blowing&mdash;everlasting
sneezing and coughing, &amp;c.: such matters are
mere trifles in the estimate of your professed snuff-takers;
but I do speak of an habitual depression of spirits, and frequently
an access of the most miserable melancholy, to which
this gentleman was subject, and which I attribute to his inveterate
habit of snuff-taking, and to no other cause. He
would complain bitterly of his wretchedness on those occasions,
and ascribe it to the skyey influences&mdash;the humidity of our
climate, the fogs, and I know not what besides; but it was
nothing but “the snuff.” Such intelligence would have
doubtless been very unwelcome; for this very snuff&mdash;this
actual <i lang="la">fons et origo malorum</i>, ay, “more snuff”&mdash;was his
most favourite remedy and consolation under these distressing
visitations! So much for our ignorance of causes.</p>

<p>The late Doctor Adam Clarke was a great enemy to the
tobacco leaf, and published a strong paper in condemnation
of it. He takes high ground upon the subject.</p>

<p>“That it is sinful to use it, as most do,” he says, “I have
no doubt&mdash;if destroying the constitution, and vilely squandering
away the time and money which God has given for other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
purposes, may be termed sinful. I have observed some whole
families, and very poor ones too, who have used tobacco in all
possible ways, and some of them for more than half a century.
Now, suppose the whole family, consisting of four, five, or
six, to have used but 1s. 6d. worth a-week, then, in the mere
article of tobacco, nearly £200 sterling is totally and irrecoverably
lost in the course of fifty years. Were all the
attending expenses, such as appropriate implements, neglect
of business, and other concomitants, taken into account, probably
four times the sum would be too small an estimate.”</p>

<p>Captain Scott, in his interesting work “Rambles in Egypt
and Candia,” says&mdash;</p>

<p>“All the Arab race are addicted to the use of the pipe, and
to this pernicious habit may be traced the origin of most of
their vices, and a great proportion of their misery.” And
again, in a note, he observes&mdash;“Nothing tends so much
as the pernicious and universal habit of smoking to retard all
improvement amongst the natives of the East, producing
habitual indolence, and occasioning an irreparable loss of
time.” He calls it elsewhere the “predominant vice of
Mahomedanism.” Now, with such warning and such examples
before me, I own that I cannot contemplate the possibility
of my countrymen becoming a nation of smokers,
without the utmost pain. I would wish to put all parties, but
especially the young, on their guard against the insidious and
seductive approaches of the habit. The elegant pipe, the
splendid snuff-box, and all the curious conveniences of tube,
light, tobacco-pouch, and so on, are so many lures to the
unwary; and many, by simply nibbling at these captivating
baits, have been gradually led on, and at last turned into
confirmed consumers. There is a temptation in the furniture
of our fashionable snuff and cigar shops&mdash;“divans,” as they
are called, which it is hard to resist. It would seem almost
worth while to “consume,” for the sake of encompassing oneself
with such beautiful toys; but I class all such resorts in the
same category with the gin-palaces of London. Look to the
end&mdash;observe what a confirmed habit of snuffing or smoking
is&mdash;how wasteful, how enervating, how every way pernicious!
The tyranny of it is dreadful. No man knows it thoroughly
but he who has once been its slave. The craving of the nose
once accustomed to be fed, for snuff&mdash;of the throat and
fauces once seasoned to the use, for smoke&mdash;and of the
teeth and gums once used to be drawn, for the reiterate
chew&mdash;oh, it is dreadful!&mdash;and I say there is no remedy
against the evil but teetotalism.</p>

<p>I have said nothing on those popular stimulants, tea and
coffee, for, as generally used, I think they are both innocent,
as they are certainly agreeable beverages. Let not my fair
countrywomen, however, when they indulge in the “cup that
cheers but not inebriates”&mdash;I mean the Howqua, or any other
tea-mixture&mdash;aim at celebrity for preparing it over strong;
for in this state, like other stimulants that we have been considering,
I have no doubt that it is bad for weak nerves.</p>

<p class="right">F.</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">People with one Idea.</span>&mdash;There are people who have but
one idea: at least if they have more, they keep it a secret, for
they never talk but of one subject. There is Major C&mdash;&mdash;;
he has but one idea, or subject of discourse, Parliamentary
Reform. Now, Parliamentary Reform is (as far as I know)
a very good thing, a very good idea, and a very good subject
to talk about; but why should it be the only one? To hear
the worthy and gallant Major resume his favourite topic is
like law-business, or a person who has a suit in Chancery
going on. Nothing can be attended to, nothing can be talked
of but that. Now it is getting on, now again it is standing
still; at one time the Master has promised to pass judgment
by a certain day, at another he has put it off again, and called
for more papers; and both are equally reasons for speaking
of it. Like the piece of pack-thread in the barrister’s hands,
he turns and twists it all ways, and cannot proceed a step
without it. Some schoolboys cannot read but in their own
book; and the man of one idea cannot converse out of his
own subject. Conversation it is not, but a sort of recital of
the preamble of a bill, or a collection of grave arguments for
a man’s being of opinion with himself. It would be well if
there was any thing of character, any thing of eccentricity in
all this; but that is not the case. It is a political homily personified,
a walking common-place we have to encounter and
listen to. It is just as if a man was to insist on your hearing
him go through the fifth chapter of the Book of Judges every
time you meet, or like the story of the Cosmogony in the
Vicar of Wakefield. It is a tune played on a barrel-organ.
It is a common vehicle of discourse into which people get and
are set down when they please, without any pains or trouble
to themselves. Neither is it professional pedantry or trading
quackery: it has no excuse. The man has no more to do
with the question which he saddles on all his hearers than you
have. This is what makes the matter hopeless. If a farmer
talks to you about his pigs or his poultry, or a physician about
his patients, or a lawyer about his briefs, or a merchant about
stock, or an author about himself, you know how to account
for this; it is a common infirmity; you have a laugh
at his expense, and there is no more to be said. But here is
a man who goes out of his way to be absurd, and is troublesome
by a romantic effort of generosity. You cannot say to
him, “All this may be interesting to you, but I have no concern
in it;” you cannot put him off in that way. He has got
possession of a subject which is of universal and paramount
interest, and on that plea may hold you by the button as long
as he chooses. His delight is to harangue on what nowise
regards himself; how then can you refuse to listen to what
as little amuses you? The business admits of no delay. The
question stands first on the order of the day&mdash;takes precedence
in its own right of every other question. Any other
topic, grave or gay, is looked upon in the light of impertinence,
and sent to Coventry. Business is an interruption to
it, pleasure a digression from it. As Cicero says of study, it
follows the man into the country, it stays with him at home;
it sits with him at breakfast, and goes out with him to dinner.
It is like a part of his dress, of the costume of his person,
without which he would be at a loss what to do. If he meets
you in the street, he accosts you with it as a form of salutation;
if you see him at his own house, it is supposed you
come upon that. If you happen to remark, “it is a fine day,”
or “the town is full,” it is considered as a temporary compromise
of the question; you are suspected of not going the
whole length of the principle. Is not this a species of sober
madness more provoking than the real? Has not the theoretical
enthusiast his mind as much warped, as much enslaved
by one idea, as the acknowledged lunatic, only that the former
has no lucid intervals? If you see a visionary of this
class going along the street, you can tell as well what he is
thinking of and will say next as the man that fancies himself
a tea-pot or the Czar of Muscovy. The one is as inaccessible
to reason as the other: if the one raves, the other dotes!&mdash;<cite>Hazlitt’s
Table-Talk.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Comfortable Circumstances favour Foresight.</span>&mdash;It
is a most remarkable fact, totally at variance with what
might <i lang="la">a priori</i> be expected, but confirmed by the universal
experience of mankind, that the dominion of reason over the
passions, the habit of foresight, and the power of forming a
systematic plan for the conduct of life, are just in proportion
<em>to the degree in which the danger of immediate or the pressure
of actual suffering has been removed from mankind</em>. The
savage who has no stock whatever for his support&mdash;who is in
danger of immediate starvation, if his wonted supplies from
the chase or his herds were to fail&mdash;is totally regardless of the
future in every part of the world; while the rich man, whose
subsistence and affluence are almost beyond the reach of
chance, is incessantly in disquietude about the manner in
which his subsequent life is to be spent. The certain prospect
of instant death to himself and all that are dear to him, from
the occurrence of a probable event, is unable to draw the attention
of the one from the enjoyments of the moment; while
the slight and improbable chance of a diminution in the smallest
articles of <em>future</em> comfort, renders the other indifferent to
the means of <em>present</em> enjoyment which are within his reach.&mdash;<cite>Alison’s
Principles of Population.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Appreciation.</span>&mdash;After all, it is appreciation rather than
praise that is delightful. An artist, for instance, how tired
he must be of hearing his pictures called “beautiful, exquisite!”&mdash;of
being told for the one hundredth time that he has
surpassed himself; but let any one point out to him one of
his own thoughts on the canvass, which he supposed likely to
escape the general eye, and how grateful it is!</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
